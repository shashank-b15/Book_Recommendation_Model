## Project Description: 
Review2Rec is a Recommendation system Leveraging textual reviews to provide the product recommendations for the Amazon Reviews. Our Approach was to find the similarities based on the metric from vector embedding of the reviews. The Project includes doing the text Analysis on text reviews, data pre-processing, and then building the recommendation engine based on the processed text reviews. 
The dataset for our research work is Kaggle Amazon Kindle-reviews data set which has users reviews at least 5 products or and a product was reviewed by at least 5 users. Where each review is transformed to a embedding vector using pre trained model/transformers, and then searching the users with similar vectors and building the recommendation engine.
